# The MET Explorer

This web-app was created with Create React App.

## Description

The API used is the The Metropolitan Museum of Art Collection API, that provides select datasets of information on more than 470,000 artworks in its Collection for unrestricted commercial and noncommercial use.

The application shows in the main page a list of cards that contain the title of the department and an image obtained from a random art piece inside that department.

After you select one of the departments, the application takes you to a separate page with information on the department. There it will show a list of cards with art and information on 15 relevant objects inside the department.

## Technologies

HTML, CSS, React, React Router and Fetch.

### Future Improvements

- Implement a search feature.
- Implement infinite scroll.
